## project summary

This repository contains a quantitative analysis of blues lyrics performed by artists across time and socio-cultural groups. It specifically trains a gradient boosting classifier using the Catboost library to predict the use of certain features of African American English in a corpus of 270 studio recorded songs. This analysis is a part of my PhD project on the use of African American English features as indexical expressions of authenticity in blues music.
